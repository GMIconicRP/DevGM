### Development and classification for any relevant gamemodes.

This repository is used mainly for discussion and suggestions with regards to any development petraining to any gamemodes that are worked on. Before viewing or commenting on any stated issues and such, please *ensure* that you've read all relevant documents and guidelines.

#### GUIDELINES FOR DevGM:
1. All content within this repository should be relevant and open for discussion in the stated projects.
2. Do **NOT** by any means, *leak* any portion of information stated here. Links to this discussion should be **be subjected to IceSeasons and liveaction29**.
3. If possible, support any statements and ideas with evidence. Having picture illustrations, videos or maybe even a draft or a sketch will definitely help your idea out better, and it will at least give us more structure as to what you like.
4. Refrain from discussing any projects (conversations etc.) in this repository. This link is **public**, and it will jeopardize some of the development here. **This includes any restricted documents only visible to selected members of the development.**
5. Classify and give tags to your idea. It will be difficult for us to put your idea in a category if it is generally varied among a number of categories.

Anyway, I hope you would enjoy development and discussion of this as much as I do. Development will take some time since I am the only developer and that I have some commitments to take care of as well.
